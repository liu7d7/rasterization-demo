naming scheme:
- structs: struct thing {};
- 'constructors': thing thing_new() {}
- 'member functions': thing_fn(thing *thing) {}
- free functions: fn() {}

goal: you "understand" all the math, and you make all your own art

genre: jrpg x mmo? x open world
rule: take one, leave the rest
setting: fantasy
theme: switching of roles --> individual vs community
       adding on to this, maybe something climate/dystopia related?
       hegemony

extra bits:
  style of rendering: try out halftoning! <-- how will this fit in with the game idea?
    perhaps the implant vision is done with halftoning but reality is harsher
    or maybe the other way around? wouldn't halftoning look harser --> be reality?

main story:
  it's a dystopian future, everyone has implants to make it *look* like the env
    is fine but in reality it isn't.
  start out at house, go to work in a

technical stuff:
  common issues? check whether size is in bytes or in elements
    stride & offset in bytes!

  what kind of world do we use?
    perhaps procedurally generated & modeled stuff

ticking issue:
  render thread still on old state, but dt wraps around to zero again.

cull face is always off, set state to disabled after rendering w/ culling
